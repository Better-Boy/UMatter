# Channel Statistics

Channel Statistics are very important for analyzing how appreciative the users in the channel are. Emoji distribution (Company values) in a channel also reveal how good is the team in following the company values and vision.

In order to view the statistics of a channel, the command is as follows:

`/umatter channel stats start_date end_date`  
start_date and end_date to be in yyyy-mm-dd format.   
For ex. `/umatter channel stats 2020-02-12 2020-02-24`

This command should be issued from a public/private channel not from a direct message channel.

The following are shown in the channel statistics
1. Emoji distribution on the appreciation posts
2. Total Number of appreciation posts

Note: The graph is generated dynamically.
